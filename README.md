# PriceScraper
Python 3 code that scrapes Amazon (and eventually more) for prices


## Setup
1.) Download [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

2.) Download [Chome web driver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
  - Note where this is downloaded to. You will need this for configuration

3.) Download [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

4.) requirements.txt includes all required python libraries and versions. I would recomend creating a new [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/), activating it, and calling the following in the terminal of the requirements.txt directory: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 


## config.json
